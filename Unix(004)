What is the Difference between cp and ln command in Unix?

The cp command creates an actual copy of a file elsewhere on your hard drive. 
The ln command creates either a hard or symbolic link to the file you specify.
(If you perform the ln command on a file, and delete the original file, the links won't work).
In ln command,The use of a hard link allows multiple filenames to be associated with the same file since a hard link points to the inode of a given file, the data of which is stored on disk.
On the other hand, symbolic links are special files that refer to other files by name.
The ln command by default creates hard links, and when called with the command line parameter ln '-s' creates symbolic links.
